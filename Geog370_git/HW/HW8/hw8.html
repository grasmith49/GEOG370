    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
    <h1>Grace Smith</h1>
    <h2><b>Question:</b></h2>
    <p>What counties (Cumberland, Bladen, Sampson, Duplin, Wayne, Lenoir, and Green (NC)) have rivers and streams that are within 1 mile of a swine feeding facility?</p>
    <h2><b>Methods of Geoprocessing Used:</b></h2>
    <p> - Clip of North Carolina hydrology and Cumberland, Bladen, Sampson, Duplin, Wayne, Lenoir, and Green counties to get the hydrology of just these counties.</p>
    <p> - Buffer of 1 mile arround each swine facility in Cumberland, Bladen, Sampson, Duplin, Wayne, Lenoir, and Green counties.</p>
    <p> - Intersection of 1 mile buffer and the hydrology (rivers and streams) of the counties.</p>
    <h2><b>Map Produced:</b></h2>

    <h2><b>Answer:</b></h2>
    <p>All 7 counties have sections of streams and rivers that are within 1 mile of a swine feeding facility as seen by the red lines on the map above. It should be noted though that Sampson, Duplin, and Greene counties visually seem to have the greatest proportion of streams and rivers within 1 mile of a swine feeding facility. This is likely due to the fact that these facilities are the most concentrated in these counties. This question and answer is important to examine as it can help counties identify sections of streams and rivers that may need extra protection. The reason for this protection as it relates to swine feeding facilities is that these facilities often have lagoons carying swine feces that can overflow during large precipitation events and cause major water quality issues for the surounding areas, especially if they are near bodies of water. </p>
