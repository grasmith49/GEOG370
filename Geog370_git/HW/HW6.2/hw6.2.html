    <h1>Homework 6: Census data choropleth - Part 2</h1>
    <h1>Grace Smith</h1>
    <p>The data presented in the maps below is the same, just presented in different modes of classification. The data is of employment of individuals in South Carolina in 2021. The ratio that was made was between the female working populaiton and the overal working population (female employed population/total working population). I did this to see where females took up more of the work force proportionally than in other areas. It should be noted that 2021 data was still likely impacted by the layoffs and furloughs that arrose due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p><b>NOTE: I was not able to use the same exact data as part 1 of Homework 6 because it was already in a ratio. But this is similar concerning employment in South Carolina in 2021.</b></p>
    <h2><u>Equal Interval Mode</u></h2>
    <p>A pro to this mode is that it is easy to scale the ranges of each class. But a con of this mode is that if many areas are similar you it is difficult to distinguish between them. Additionally there is the possibility that a class could be not recognized on the graph if a county did not have a proportiton in that set range (is not really that specific to the data).</p>

    <h2><u>Equal Count (Quantile) Mode</u></h2>
    <p>A pro to tthiss mode is that all classes will be shown on the map (the ranges are more specific to the data). Another pro of this mode is the ability to easily find the median of the data. A con of this mode is that there can be lots of variation within a class and not much variation bettween classes, making the classes seem arbitrary.</p>

    <h2><u>Natural Breaks Mode</u></h2>
    <p>A pro of this mode is that you can easily recognize clusters of data versus outliers. A con of this mode is that the classes have different ranges which can make it hard to follow.</p>
