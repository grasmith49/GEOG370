    <p>A pro to this mode is that it is easy to scale the ranges of each class. But a con of this mode is that if many areas are similar you it is difficult to distinguish between them. Additionally there is the possibility that a class could be not recognized on the graph if a county did not have a proportiton in that set range (is not really that specific to the data).</p>
