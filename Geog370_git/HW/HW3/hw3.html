    <h1>Homework 3 - World Projection Maps</h1>
    <h3>    For the purposes of Homework 3, I used different world projections in QGIS.
        In QGIS, I opened global contries data from Natural Data, as was provided on 
        Sakai. I then used the Indicatrix mapper pluggin to put Tissot's indicatrix on 
        the map. Then in project properties I changed the world projections to the ones
        listed below and downloaded them as png files before moving onto the next world
        projection. By looking at the different world projections, I was able to 
        understand how they have strengths and weakness, particularly in how they warp 
        and portray the different continents.</h3>
